## Project Description

This project demonstrates a networking scenario involving smoke detectors and fire alarms using Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) files. The simulation models the communication and interaction of these devices within a virtual network environment.

## File Format

The project is developed using Cisco Packet Tracer, and the simulation is saved in the .pkt file format. This format encapsulates the network topology, configurations, and device behaviors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Cisco Packet Tracer software (Version X.X or higher) must be installed on your computer.
- Basic understanding of networking concepts.

### Installation of Cisco Packet Tracer

1. Visit the official Cisco Networking Academy website.
2. Download and install Cisco Packet Tracer according to your operating system.

### Opening the Project

1. Clone this repository or download the .pkt file from [link to your .pkt file].
2. Launch Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. Open the downloaded .pkt file from the **File** menu within Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Simulation

### Smoke Detection

1. Navigate to the smoke detector device in the simulation.
2. Trigger the simulated smoke detection event.
3. Observe how this event affects the network.

### Fire Alarm

1. Locate the fire alarm devices in the simulation.
2. Simulate the activation of the fire alarms.
3. Analyze the network's response to the fire alarm.
